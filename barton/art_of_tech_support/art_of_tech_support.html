<p>In <em>Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain</em>, Betty Edwards makes the argument that learning to draw is not a trick of hand-eye coordination, but rather of teaching yourself how to see -- being able to see the lines and contours rather than creating symbols, which act as mental shortcuts.

<p>The challenge of technical support is analogous -- In the field of tech support, the symbols come in the form of assumptions and preconceived notions of what the problems are. Seeing what is actually happening, rather than relying on assumptions, is the art of technical support.</p>
