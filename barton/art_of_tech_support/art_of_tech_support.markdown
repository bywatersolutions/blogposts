# The Art of Tech Support

In _Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain_, Betty Edwards makes the
argument that learning to draw is not a trick of hand-eye coordination,
but rather of teaching yourself how to see -- being able to see the
lines and contours rather than creating symbols, which act as mental
shortcuts. The book contains a series of exercises which teach you how to
bypass the symbolic part of the brain, such as drawing the shape of the
negative space around an object -- which is something that you can see,
but not in a way that your brain can attach symbols to. The changes in
drawing style brought about by choosing to see what is there, versus what
our mind tells us should be there are startling. These images were drawn
by the same person, four days apart:

The challenge of technical support is analogous -- In
the field of tech support, the symbols come in the form of assumptions
and preconceived notions of what the problems are. Seeing what is
actually happening, rather than relying on assumptions, is the art of
technical support.
