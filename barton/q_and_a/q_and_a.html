<p><em>Where can partners go to learn SQL Reports?</em></p>
<p>W3schools SQL tutorial: <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/sql/" class="uri">http://www.w3schools.com/sql/</a></p>
<p>This isn't koha specific but once you get the basic structure you can use the Koha reports library and the Koha schema to begin to build out reports.</p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.koha-community.org/wiki/SQL_Reports_Library" class="uri">https://wiki.koha-community.org/wiki/SQL_Reports_Library</a></p>
<p><a href="http://schema.koha-community.org/" class="uri">http://schema.koha-community.org/</a></p>
<p>Taking reports from the library and making changes is a good way to learn too. The basic syntax for a report is a combination of three statements:</p>
<p>1 - <code>SELECT</code>: This is where you define the information you want, and you determine the name of a column by checking the table in the schema e.g. for biblio look here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://schema.koha-community.org/master/tables/biblio.html" class="uri">http://schema.koha-community.org/master/tables/biblio.html</a></li>
<li>find column names: author, title, notes, biblionumber...</li>
</ul>
<p>2 - <code>FROM</code>: This is where you name the table you are using, see schema for tables available (e.g. biblio, borrowers, issues, etc.)</p>
<p>3 - <code>WHERE</code>: These are conditions on the data. E.g. 'Items that are checked out' translates to items.onloan IS NOT NULL</p>
<h2 id="searching">Searching</h2>
<p><em>The availablity numbers don't look right on the search results screen, why not?</em></p>
<p>There is a limit to how many items Koha will check in search results -- look at the system preference MaxSearchResultsItemsPerRecordStatusCheck</p>
<h2 id="searching-1">Searching</h2>
<p><em>Why am I getting an internal server error when I search?</em></p>
<p>The item homebranch or holdingbranch is set to a branchcode that is not defined in the branches table.</p>
<p>Or</p>
<p><code>items.onloan</code> is set to <code>0000-00-00 00:00:00</code>.</p>
<p><em>Why do some items show as available and checked out in search results at the same time?</em></p>
<p>Who an item was checked out to is stored in the 'issues' table in Koha. The due date is also stored in <code>items.onloan</code>, which sometimes gets st to null.</p>
<p><em>Why don't bibs with lots of items (e.g. serials) show in zebra search?</em></p>
<p>This is caused by <a href="https://bugs.koha-community.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=15399">Bug 15399 MARCXML records larger than 1 MB (1048576 bytes) are not searchable</a></p>
<p>Bywater has some work-arounds for this.</p>
<p><em>I have an bib that has many items attached, why do I only see 20 in the search results?</em></p>
<p>This is controlled by the maxItemsInSearchResults system preference.</p>
