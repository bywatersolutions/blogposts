<p>One of the little bits of lore that ByWater uses when talking about item types is that one of our libraries had collection of cake pans that patrons could borrow. In my recent visit to Athens County Public library, I found that they have a &quot;Gadgets&quot; item type that includes, among other things, a &quot;Kill-a-watt&quot; home electric tester. The use of 3d-printers is becoming widespread. We have a couple of partners who run a seed kit lending program where a packet of seeds is lent, and seeds from the harvested plants are returned at the end of the season.</p>
<p>This got me wondering, what's the most unusual item that our partners have in their library? I'll take answers in the comments or on the ByWater Partners' mailing list.</p>
